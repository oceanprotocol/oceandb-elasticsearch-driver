## Features

Elasticsearch driver to connect implementing OceanDB.

## Prerequisites

You should have running a elasticsearch instance.

## Quickstart

First of all we have to specify where is allocated our config.
To do that we have to pass the following argument:

```
--config=/path/of/my/config
```

If you do not provide a configuration path, by default the config is expected in the config folder.

In the configuration we are going to specify the following parameters to

```yaml
    [oceandb]

    enabled=true            # In order to enable or not the plugin
    module=elasticsearch    # You can use one the plugins already created. Currently we have elasticsearch, mongodb and bigchaindb.
    module.path=            # You can specify the location of your custom plugin.
    db.hostname=localhost   # Address of your Elasticsearch instance.
    db.port=9200            # Port of your Elasticsearch rest API.
    db.username=elastic     # If you are using authentication, elasticsearch username.
    db.password=changeme    # If you are using authentication, elasticsearch password.
    db.index=oceandb        # Elasticsearch index name
```

Once you have defined this the only thing that you have to do it is use it:

```python

    oceandb = OceanDb(conf)
    oceandb.write({"value": "test"}, id)

```

## Environment variables

When you want to instantiate an Oceandb plugin you can provide the next environment variables:

- **$CONFIG_PATH**
- **$MODULE**
- **$DB_HOSTNAME**
- **$DB_PORT**
- **$DB_INDEX**
- **$DB_USERNAME**
- **$DB_PASSWORD**

## Code style

The information about code style in python is documented in this two links [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
and [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).

## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our test use pytest framework.

## New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using as first argument {major|minor|patch} to bump accordingly the version.
